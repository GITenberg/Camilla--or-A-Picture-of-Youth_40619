description: First published in 1796, Camilla deals with the matrimonial concerns
  of a group of young people-Camilla Tyrold and her sisters, the daughters of a country
  parson, and their cousin Indiana Lynmere-and, in particular, with the love affair
  between Camilla herself and her eligible suitor, EdgarMandlebert. The path of true
  love, however, is strewn with intrigue, contretemps and misunderstanding. An enormously
  popular eighteenth-century novel, Camilla is touched at many points by the advancing
  spirit of romanticism. As in Evelina, Fanny Burney weaves into her novel strands
  of light and dark, comic episodes and gothic shudders, and creates a pattern of
  social and moral dilemmas whichemphasize and illuminate the gap between generations.
